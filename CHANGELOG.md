# Changelog

All notable changes to token-diet will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

* `CLAUDE.md` — project guidance for Claude Code sessions (structure, commands, conventions)
* `README.md` — project overview for the token-diet installer stack
* `README.md` — internal forge mirroring guide: staying in sync with `--mirror`, Forgejo/GitLab pull mirror tip

### Fixed

* `install.sh` — OpenCode Serena integration now writes to `~/.opencode.json` instead of printing info-only
* `Install.ps1` — OpenCode Serena integration now writes to `%USERPROFILE%\.opencode.json` instead of manual-config warning
* Both scripts pass `--context=ide` to Serena for OpenCode (correct context for non-LSP agent hosts)

### Changed

* Submodule forks (rtk, tilth, serena) point to security-patched versions with `## This Fork` documentation
